# AstralPilot - A Brain Controlled Drone

"Astral Pilot: A Brain-Controlled Drone" represents a groundbreaking project harnessing the
power of EEG signals to control drones. Electroencephalography (EEG) is employed to capture
electrical activity in the brain, allowing users to command drones through their thoughts. The
project introduces a seamless interface between human cognition and unmanned aerial vehicles,
opening up new horizons in the field of human-machine interaction.

To ensure precise control, extensive preprocessing of EEG signals was implemented. This included
rigorous noise removal and artifact elimination using band-pass filtering techniques. The result is
a refined and reliable set of signals that accurately represent the user's intentions. The core
innovation lies in the application of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), enabling the
classification of EEG signals into four distinct classes corresponding to essential drone commands:
take-off, land, move forward, and move backward.

One of the project's key advantages is its user-independent nature, allowing a wide range of
individuals to effortlessly control the drone without the need for individualized calibration.
Moreover, the system exhibits negligible lag, ensuring real-time responsiveness to the user's
mental commands. "Astral Pilot" not only pushes the boundaries of human-machine collaboration
but also lays the foundation for future advancements in brain-machine interfaces, promising a
seamless and efficient control mechanism for drones and potentially other technologies.
